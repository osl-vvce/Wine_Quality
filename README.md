**WINE QUALITY TESTING**

**Wine Dataset:**

The Red Wine Dataset is public available for research in the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository created by Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) in 2009. It is also available on kaggle datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

**Factors and Analysis:**

There are various factors which decide the quality of wine. In the dataset taken, there are 12 columns; the first 11 of which contains factors like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugars, chlorides etc. The 12th column contains the quality, which gives a numerical value from 0-10. This value in turn depends on the 11 factors. If the quality value is greater than 7, then the wine is of a good quality and a value below 7, indicates that the wine is usually not a good wine. The context is to study how the different prediction algorithms determines and predicts the wine quality.
